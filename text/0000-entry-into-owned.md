# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Enable the map Entry API to take borrowed keys as arguments, cloning only when
necessary (in `VacantEntry::insert`). The proposed implementation introduces a
new trait `std::borrow::AsBorrowOf` which enables the existing `entry` methods
to accept borrows. In effect, it makes the following possible:

```rust
  let string_map: HashMap<String, u64> = ...;
  let clone_map: HashMap<Cloneable, u64> = ...;
  let nonclone_map: HashMap<NonCloneable, u64> = ...;

  // ...

  *string_map.entry("foo").or_insert(0) += 1;                  // Clones if "foo" not in map.
  *string_map.entry("bar".to_string()).or_insert(0) += 1;      // By-value, never clones.

  *clone_map.entry(&Cloneable::new()).or_insert(0) += 1;       // Clones if key not in map.
  *clone_map.entry(Cloneable::new()).or_insert(0) += 1;        // By-value, never clones.

  *nonclone_map.entry(NonCloneable::new()).or_insert(0) += 1;  // Can't and doesn't clone.
```

implementation](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/37143).

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

The motivation for this change is the same as the one laid out in [#1533](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1533)
by @gereeter. Below is an adapted version of their `Motivation` section:

The Entry API for maps allows users to save time by allowing them to perform
arbitrary modifications at a given key dependent upon whether that key was
present and if it was, what value was previously there. However, although
insertion is the only action the user might take that requires a by-value key,
there is no way to create an Entry without a fully owned key. When the user only
has a by-reference key on hand, this is inefficient at best, requiring an
unnecessary .to_owned that may involve an expensive allocation and/or copy, and
unusable at worst, if the key cannot be cloned.

Consider a simple word count example:

```rust
fn word_count(text: &str) -> HashMap<String, u64> {
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    for word in text.split_whitespace() {
        *map.entry(word.to_owned()).or_insert(0) += 1;
    }
    map
}
```

For a large enough text corpus, in the vast majority of cases the entry will be
occupied and the newly allocated owned string will be dropped right away,
wasting precious cycles. We would like the following to work.

```rust
fn word_count(text: &str) -> HashMap<String, u64> {
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    for word in text.split_whitespace() {
        *map.entry(word).or_insert(0) += 1;
    }
    map
}
```

with a conditional `.to_owned` call inside the `Entry` implementation.
Specifically we're looking for a fix which supports the following cases

  1. `.entry(key)` with `key: K` where `K: !Clone`.
  2. `.entry(key)` with `key: K` where `K: Clone`.
  3. `.entry(&key)` with `key: Q` where `Q: ToOwned<Owned=K>`.

# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

## Approach
To justify the approach taken by this proposal, first consider the following
(unworkable) solution:

```rust
  pub fn entry<'a, C, Q: ?Sized>(&'a self, k: C) -> Entry<'a, K, V>
        where K: Borrow<Q>,
              Q: Hash + Eq + ToOwned<Owned=K>
              C: Into<Cow<'a, Q>>
```

This would support (2) and (3) but not (1) because `ToOwned`'s blanket
implementation requires `Clone`. To work around this limitation we define a
different trait `std::borrow::AsBorrowOf`:

```rust
pub trait AsBorrowOf<T, B: ?Sized>: Sized where T: Borrow<B> {
    fn into_owned(self) -> T;
    fn as_borrow_of(&self) -> &B;
}

impl<T> AsBorrowOf<T, T> for T {
    fn into_owned(self) -> T { self }
    fn as_borrow_of(&self) -> &Self { self }
}

impl<'a, B: ToOwned + ?Sized> AsBorrowOf<B::Owned, B> for &'a B {
    fn into_owned(self) -> B::Owned { self.to_owned() }
    fn as_borrow_of(&self) -> &B { *self }
}
```

This trait defines a relationship between three types `T`, `B` and `Self` with
the following properties:

  1. There is a by-value conversion `Self` -> `T`.
  2. Both `T` and `Self` can be borrowed as `&B`.

These properties are precisely what we need from an `entry` query: we need (2)
to hash and/or compare the query against existing keys in the map and we need (1)
to convert the query into a key on `VacantEntry::insert`.

The two impl-s capture that

  1. `T` can always be converted to `T` and borrowed as `&T`. This enables
     by-value queries regardless of their `Clone`-ability.
  2. `&B` can be converted to `B::Owned` and borrowed as `&B`, when B:
     `ToOwned`. This enables queries via borrows of `Clone` types.

Then we modify the `entry` signature (for `HashMap`, but similar for `BTreeMap`)
to

```rust
pub fn entry<'a, Q, B>(&'a self, k: Q) -> Entry<'a, K, V, Q>
      where Q: AsBorrowOf<K, B>
            K: Borrow<B>,
            B: Hash + Eq {
    // use `hash(key.as_borrow_of())` and `key.as_borrow_of() == existing_key.borrow()`
    // for comparisions and `key.into_owned()` on `VacantEntry::insert`.
}
```

### Deref coercions and backwards compatibility

An unexpected backwards compatibility hazard comes from deref coercions.
Consider:

```rust
fn increment<'a>(map: &mut HashMap<&'a str, u32>, key: &'a String) {
    *map.entry(key).or_insert(0) += 1;
}
```

Currently this compiles just fine: `&'a String` is coerced to `&'a str` because
`String: Deref<str>`, but if `entry` becomes generic, deref coercions stop
working automatically. We can either accept this backwards incompatibility, or
we can use specialisation and introduce a new `AsBorrowOf` impl:

```rust
// Same as before, but with specialisable `default` methods.
impl<T> AsBorrowOf<T, T> for T {
    default fn into_owned(self) -> T { self }
    default fn as_borrow_of(&self) -> &Self { self }
}

// Allow `&'a T` to be used as queries in a map with `&'a U` keys as long as
// `T: Deref<Target=U>`.
impl<'a, T: Deref> AsBorrowOf<&'a T::Target, T::Target> for &'a T {
    default fn into_owned(self) -> &'a T::Target { self.deref() }
    default fn as_borrow_of(&self) -> &T::Target { self.deref() }
}

// ... (impl for `ToOwned` stays unchanged) ...
```

I think this `impl` is worth the downside of bringing in specialisation into the
mix, compared to the downside of backwards incompatibility.

## Detailed changes:

Also see [working implementation](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/37143)
for diff.

  1. Add `std::borrow::AsBorrowOf` as described in previous section.
  2. Change the signature of `{HashMap,BTreeMap}::entry` to the one described
     above. Change the implementation to use `key.as_borrow_of()` to search the
     map.
  2. Change `Entry` to add `Q` and `B` type parameters defaulted to `K` for
     backwards compatibility (for `HashMap` and `BTreeMap`). `VacantEntry` will
     now store a query of type `Q` rather than an actual key of type `K`. On
     `insert` a call to `AsBorrowOf::<K, B>::into_owned` is made to convert the
     query into an owned key to use in the map.
  3. Move `Entry::key`, `VacantEntry::key` and `VacantEntry::into_key` to a
     separate `impl` block to be implemented only for the `Q=K` case.


# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

1. The docs of `entry` get uglier and introduce a new trait the user
   never needs to manually implement.

2. It does not offer a way of recovering a `!Clone` key when no `insert`
   happens. This is somewhat orthogonal though and could be solved in a number
   of different ways eg. an `into_query` method on `Entry`.

4. The changes to `entry` would be insta-stable (not the new traits). There's
   no real way of feature-gating this.

5. Like any change of this nature (changing a concrete parameter to trait bound
   type), it is not fully backwards compatibile since it may break inference in
   a few places:
     * Uses of maps where `entry` is the only call (`K` can no longer be
       inferred as the argument of `entry` if `K` is a reference type).
     * Uses of `entry(something.into())` may become ambiguous if `something` is
       a reference.
     * Inference may also hit issue [#37138](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/37138).

6. The additional `B` type parameter on `Entry` is superfluous and exposed to
   any non-`Entry<K, V, K, K>` wrappers of `Entry`. It would be great if we
   could make `B` an associated type (see 'Unresolved Questions').

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

1. Keyless entries ([#1533](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1533)):

     1. Con: An additional method to the Map API which is strictly more general,
        yet less ergonomic than `entry`.

     2. Con: The duplication footgun around having to pass in the same key twice
        or risk corrupting the map.

     3. Pro: Solves the recovery of `!Clone` keys.

2. Add a new `entry_or_clone` method with an `Q: Into<Cow<K>>` bound.

     1. Con: Adds a new method as well as new `Entry` types for all maps.

     2. Con: Passes on the problem to any generic users of maps with every layer
        of abstraction needing to provide an `or_clone` variant.

     3. Pro: probably clearest backwards compatible solution, doesn't introduce
        any new traits.

3. Be more honest about the purpose of the trait and call it
   `std::collections::Query` with `into_key`, `borrow_as_key` methods.

4. Split `AsBorrowOf` into `AsBorrowOf` and `IntoOwned`. This is closer to the
   original proposal in this RFC:

     1. Con: Requires introducing three new traits instead of one.

     2. Con: Requires specialisation to implement a public API, tying us closer
        to current parameters of specialisation.

     3. Pro: `IntoOwned` may be independently useful as a more general
        `ToOwned`.

     4. Pro: no additional `B` type parameter on `on_insert` and
        `on_insert_with`.

Code:
```rust
pub trait IntoOwned<T> {
    fn into_owned(self) -> T;
}

impl<T> IntoOwned<T> for T {
    default fn into_owned(self) -> Self {
        self
    }
}

impl<T> IntoOwned<T::Owned> for T
    where T: RefIntoOwned
{
    default fn into_owned(self) -> T::Owned {
        self.ref_into_owned()
    }
}

pub trait AsBorrowOf<T, B: ?Sized>: IntoOwned<T> where T: Borrow<B> {
    fn as_borrow_of(&self) -> &B;
}

impl<T> AsBorrowOf<T, T> for T {
    default fn as_borrow_of(&self) -> &Self {
        self
    }
}

impl<'a, B: ToOwned + ?Sized> AsBorrowOf<B::Owned, B> for &'a B {
    default fn as_borrow_of(&self) -> &B {
        *self
    }
}

// Auxilliary trait to get around coherence issues.
pub trait RefIntoOwned {
    type Owned: Sized;

    fn ref_into_owned(self) -> Self::Owned;
}

impl<'a, T: ?Sized> RefIntoOwned for &'a T
    where T: ToOwned
{
    type Owned = <T as ToOwned>::Owned;

    fn ref_into_owned(self) -> T::Owned {
        (*self).to_owned()
    }
}

```

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

1. Are the backwards compatibility hazards acceptable?
2. Is the `IntoOwned` version preferable?
3. Do we include the `Deref` impl for `AsBorrowOf` to keep deref coercions
   working?
4. The `B` parameter of `AsBorrowOf` is really inconvenient, especially because
   it propagates to the `Entry` types. Conceptually, it's an associated type
   (for a `K, Q` pair, there's only one `B` for which `Q: AsBorrowOf<K, B>`, but
   I wasn't able to get coherence to work with a `type Borrowed`. Can it be
   done?
